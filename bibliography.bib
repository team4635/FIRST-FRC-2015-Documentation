    abstract = {{In this paper it will be shown that according to the molecular-kinetic theory of heat, bodies of microscopically-visible size suspended in a liquid will perform movements of such magnitude that they can be easily observed in a microscope, on account of the molecular motions of heat. It is possible that the movements to be discussed here are identical with the so-called '' Brownian molecular motion ”; however, the information available to me regarding the latter is so lacking in precision, that I can form no judgment in the matter.}},

@article{Determinismo,
Abstract = {In the present article we approach the issue of ontological determinism in physics. We propose a clarification of the concept of possibility that is useful for addressing this issue. By means of this clarification, the concept of probability can be given an interpretation that is meaningful for the practice of theoretical physics. Finally, these clarified concepts of possibility and probability are applied to the paradigmatic case of highly unstable systems, and it is argued that in this domain determinism and indeterminism can coexist in a single classical system.
